I did not discover this method, someone else had 1-2 years ago. I made this same tutorial a while ago on a small forum but decided to move it here since you need an account to access the forum. 


Basically what this does is makes you be able to record for an unlimited amount of time using GyazoGIF. If you end the gyazo link with .gif then it will speed the video up when embedded, but if you end the link with .mp4 it will stay the same speed.
